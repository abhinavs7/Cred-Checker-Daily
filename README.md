# Cred-Checker Daily

## Description / Problem Solved / Purpose: ##

Fake news here! Fake news there! Fake news everywhere! Our world is constantly feeding us news that just doesn't make the honesty cut. So here at the Cred-Checker Daily, we decided to hold the fake news participants accountable by creating a product that allows users to assign a score to the articles they read and displaying the cumulative results to the world. 

## Implementation Functionality: ##
• Pull news data from two API's working synergistically together
• Store data from API calls into database
• Display article information, including text, from database
• Listing of Today's Top Headlines
• Show credibility ratings for all reviewed articles
• User submits a 1-10 rating for each article along with comments
• Search for articles by date
• Display modal upon click of an article
